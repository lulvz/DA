# Project Title

This is a railway network flow analysis tool that provides information about railway networks.
It also uses the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate maximum flow in a network. The network data is read from CSV files located in the `dataset` directory.
The Minimum Cost Maximum Flow algorithm is used to calculate the minimum cost of transporting a certain amount of flow in a network. The Dijkstra algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Algorithms Used

- Minimum Cost Maximum Flow: This algorithm is used to calculate the minimum cost of transporting a certain amount of flow in a network. It's implemented in [graph.cpp](src/graph.cpp).
- Dijkstra: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It's implemented in [graph.cpp](src/graph.cpp).
- Ford-Fulkerson: This algorithm is used to calculate the maximum flow in a network. It's implemented in [ford_fulkerson.cpp](src/ford_fulkerson.cpp).
